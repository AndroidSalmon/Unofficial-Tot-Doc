## Before you start

Make sure that you:
- Follow [the recommended Modload order](https://apiconan.totchinuko.fr/#/modlist?id=typical-modlist) by placing Tot!Sudo at the bottom, above other Tot mods.
- Are on a dedicated server without an existing Tot!Sudo configuration.

## Accessing the Tot!Sudo Admin Panel

The Admin panel is your go-to dashboard for all admin configuration for Tot!Sudo and any mods that use its framework. 

1. Enable vanilla Admin mode through the standard <shortcut key="$conan"/> menu. You will only need this for initial setup.

2. Press <shortcut key="$admin"/> to open the Tot!Sudo Admin Panel.

Your Super Admin Password is used to unlock a full-access toggle. Make sure you generate a secure, unique password.
